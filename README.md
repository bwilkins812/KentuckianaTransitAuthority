My plan for the future of public transportation in the Louisville metro area.

This is a personal project consisting of a fictitious public transportation network for the Louisville, KY, metropolitan area.  My initial focus is on developing a subway ticketing system that will incorporate Java, JavaScript, SQL, Spring MVC, Spring Security, etc., that will allow users to view basic subway information and purchase tickets and passes.  System administrators will be allowed to CRUD tickets, passes, stations, subway lines, and can upload photos of the various stations.  The application will also allow for a REST client access.
